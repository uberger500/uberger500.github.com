<h2>RESEARCH SKILLS</h2>
<p class="one">My expertise lies in a range of anatomical techniques including in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, 
and other staining techniques. I have developed a very sensitive, rapid and convenient method of non-isotopic in situ 
hybridization that can be applied to most body tissues and that is conducive to automation. In addition, I have created 
an in situ hybridization method that allows the simultaneous detection of two different mRNAs in the same section 
using bright-field and fluorescent illuminations. As a trained neuroscientist and neuroanatomist, my recent work has 
primarily dealt with the precise localization of mRNAs for various transporter and other proteins in the brain. However, 
I have also investigated the localization of mRNAs for various nutrient and small solute transporters in peripheral organs. 
Beside the anatomical techniques, I have extensive experience in Northern and Western blotting, biochemical enzyme assays, HPLC
 measurements, tissue culture, intracerebral stereotaxic injections and PCR. </p>
