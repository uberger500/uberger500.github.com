<h1>Urs Berger Biography</h1>
<hr/>

<p class="one">I was born in Basel Switzerland. My father worked as a postmaster and my mother was a housemaker. I have four brothers, I am number 4.
I studied biology at the University of Basel. I received a Ph.D. in cellular biology from the University of Basel for
thesis work that I had carried out in the Department of Neuroscience of the Johns Hopkings University Medical Center
in Baltimore, MD. I had postdoctoral positions at the New York University, and the Mass General and Brigham and Women's Hospitals in Boston.
I spent a year supervising a core facility that specializes in performing In Situ Hybridization for the detection of messenger RNAs at
the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Subsequently I carried out similar work as an independent consultant through
my company UB-In Situ.
	In 2011, I became in interested in Web programming and design, as well as programming. I have taken a few computer science classes
at Tufts University since then.

	I married in 1992 and live with my wife and a 16 year old daughter, and a 12 year old son in Massachussetts.
