1. There is a NaN showing up under the title in the info windows for the markers. It has to do with the function
func() I wrote to add table rows with the departure information. I don't know how to remove that.
Also, I can't remove the info for trains that have already arrived at the station.Adding a second if statement or an 
&& condition messes the display up.
The MBTA info appears not linked to a click on the marker. The page needs to reload to get a new set of times.

2. No collaborators or discussions, except I used google/Stackoverflow, and I took a look at Ming's MBTA map site.

3. Lots of time, maybe 15-20 hours.
